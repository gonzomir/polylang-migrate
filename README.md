polylang-migrate
================

A set of Ruby scripts (mainly polyglot2polylang.rb) to help migrating a WordPress blog to using the Polylang plugin for internationalization, in case you were using the Polyglot or a similar WordPress plugin before for that purpose.

For detailed usage instructions see [this article](http://ma.juii.net/blog/migrate-to-polylang).

Note that this is quick and dirty software I created for one-time usage. Use at your own risk â€“ just don't blame me if it destroys important things in your life ;)

If you extend this for own purposes, your contributions are welcome of course (just send me a merge request).
